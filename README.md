We explore how fuzzy logic-based ensemble methods‚Äîspecifically the **Sugeno fuzzy integral**‚Äîcan be leveraged to improve classification performance in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using sensor data collected from wearable devices such as smartphones and smartwatches.

## üß† Overview

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has broad applications in areas such as healthcare monitoring, fitness tracking, and smart environments. This project proposes a deep ensemble learning framework where predictions from three deep learning models are fused using the **Sugeno fuzzy integral**, with the associated fuzzy measures learned through a **genetic algorithm-based optimization** technique.

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

We use the following three base classifiers:

- **CNN-LSTM**: For temporal and spatial feature learning.
- **VGG-16-based model**: For deep spatial representation learning.
- **ResNet-18-based model**: For residual feature extraction.

The output probabilities from these models are combined using the **Sugeno fuzzy integral**. Fuzzy measures (i.e., the importance/confidence of each model) are optimized using a **Genetic Algorithm**.
